#+TITLE: SICP Chapter 2.1 Notes

/data abstraction/ is a much better word than object-oriented abstraction.   the
example used here was representing a rational number as on opaque unit with numerator
and denominator, or /compound data object/.

/selectors/ and /constructor/ type procedures as the boundary for /data abstraction/.

Valid representations of data abstractions are surprisingly difficult to formulate
rigorously.  For more detail see Liskov and Ziles (1975).
